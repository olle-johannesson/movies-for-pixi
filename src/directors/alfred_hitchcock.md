Not the most impressive Hitchcock selection, eh? Where is _Vertigo_ or _Rear Window_ or _North By Northwest_ or _The Man Who Knew Too Much_? Where's _Strangers on a Train_ for crying out loud? Well, I like _The Birds_ and I love _To Catch a Thief_ so what can I do? Who could choose the tangled psychological mess of the famous Hitchcock films when there is the impossible technicolor tan of Cary Grant to have, and not a wiff of Freud peeking through the reels? Ok, there's a little bit of Freud (the fireworks scene?), but it is kept to a minimum.

If you want to be like that though, Grace Kelly married prince Renier and moved to Monaco after filming this, and later died in a car crash (perhaps on the very road she drove fast on in _To Catch a Thief_?)

Otherwise you can just watch all Hitchcock movies. Start with _The Birds_ and _Psycho_, since they are the most famous. Then any of the ones with James Stewart, since they are generally the best and most loved by critics. Perhaps save _To Catch a Thief_ for last, because that's my favourite movie and you want to save the best for last!
