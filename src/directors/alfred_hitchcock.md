This has to be the strangest Hitchcock selection ever. Where is _Vertigo_ or _Rear Window_ or _North By Northwest_ or _The Man Who Knew Too Much_? Where's _Strangers on a Train_ for crying out loud? Well, I like _The Birds_ and I love _To Catch a Thief_ so what can I do? Who could choose the tangled psychological mess of the famous Hitchcock films when there is the impossible technicolor sun-burned Cary Grant without a wiff of Freud peeking through the reels?

If you want to be like that though, Grace Kelly married prince Renier and moved to Monaco after filming this, and later died in a car crash (perhaps on the very road she drove fast on in _To Catch a Thief_?)
