This danish wierdo has had a strange career. He was a founding member of the danish _dogma_ manifesto that steered danish cinema towards philosophically rewarding but visually annoying film. Sounds super fun, right? So later he had a lot of success in Cannes and started making movies with big hollywood names. One fun thing about von Trier is that as a boomer provocateur he can't shut up when bombing a joke. Watch interviews with him, it is amazing. Once in a press conference (for _Melancholia_, sitting next to Kirsten Dunst) he made a crack about being a nazi, and when nobody laughed he doubled down on the joke and this turned out bad for his career.
