Whenever you hear movie directors or movie lovers talk about movies, this name sometimes pops up. It usually happens when someone compares something or someone to Ingmar Bergman or one of his movies, since the movies themselves aren't discussed all that often in light conversation. There are two points to this:

- These movies are often seen as the pinnacle of arthouse
- These movies are often not as easy to digest as the latest marvel blockbuster

And it can be pretty much anyone who mentions a Bergman movie with admiration. Yes, Woody Allen loves Bergman, but shop around and you'll find all kinds of directors idolising him.

Now, this is a long career of uncompromising filmmaking we're looking at. No film historian could easily pick just two (_The Seventh Seal_ and _Persona_ would probably be chosen over _Sommaren med Monika_ though), and if you are interested in the art form of cinema, make the effort to see more of this guy.
