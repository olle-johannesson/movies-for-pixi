It is an important part of every movie-lovers journey to at some stage talk about how much he or she likes Kurosawas films. Especially _either non-samurai movie or a samurai-movie for a very special reason (but not yojimbo)_ because _blah blah blah_

Now, there is nothing strange or wrong with finding yourself in this phase. And, your'e in good company; Spielberg and all kinds of people are on record going on about how great he is. Take a look at his average IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes score, he is in the top 10 of movie-rating-ratio per director or something.

So why did only samurai movies make this list? Why not drool over how transformative _Dodes'ka-den_ was, or is, and _Ikiru_ and so on? Well, they are ofcourse great; many of his films are. But the samurai movies are super cool, and there is no changing that fact. Sorry, but thats just the way it is.
