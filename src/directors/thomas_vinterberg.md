You say you like film? You want to see scandinavian film?
You want to dip into danish film? You want to see danish film _from the 90s_ ?

Don't start with _the idiots_ on a date night. Just trust me on that one. But Thomas Vinterberg is a good start, because his movies aren't self-indulgent and annoying to watch! 

Welcome to danish film.
