Writer/Director with only four feature-titles to his writer-director auteur-name. But what a streak! _In Bruges_  should have made this list! It is really good and made the combo with Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Martin McDonagh one that everybody couldn't wait to see reunited. And then they did! _The Banshees of Inisherin_ turned the action off and the comedy down, and the drama up, and it surpassed everybodys expectations. 

This is one guy to watch. As soon as he writer-directs another one, I'm seeing it!
