title: Brian De Palma

One of the most respected directors, but we have to go the same as with Scorsese and wipe all the classics off the table to highlight that he made _that_ music video!

Tarantino tells a story that before he was a famous director he once met Brian de Palma, but didn't speak to him. He didn't want to be a nobody when he met his hero. Later, after _Reservoir Dogs_ he was invited to meet de Palma.
