Somehow this guy made _Meet the Feebles_ and _Braindead_ and then secured $93,000,000 and 2 years of filming time to make a super-epic super-serious fantasy trilogy. We should all take this as a lesson for... something. Sleeze and splatter is not the worst on a CV after all.

Event though _Lord of the Rings_ totally eclipses everything else the guy has done, it is worthwhile checking out what projects he can get funding for after such a mega-monster hit.
