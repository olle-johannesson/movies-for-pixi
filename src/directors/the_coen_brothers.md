Ok, so maybe only one is the director and the other produces. Anyway, they make **very** good movies.

I had the theory that they were making a portrait of america making one film for every part (?) of the USA. _The Big Lebowski_ for California, _No Country for Old Men_ for Texas or the desert south. _Inside Llewyn Davis_ for New York, _Fargo_ for the midwest, O Brother, Where Art Thou (which aaaalmost made this list) for the south. And so on. Then that stupid hollywood movie came out and then the wonderful _Ballad of Buster Scruggs_ and now I don't know anymore...
