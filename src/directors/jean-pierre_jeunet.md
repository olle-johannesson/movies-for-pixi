This director followed Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher directing in the _Alien_ series. You know the "keeell meee" scene in _Alien: Resurrection_ ?. Yeah, he did that. Then he did Am√©lie. Like, it was his next film!

Which was an enormous hit, launched Audrey Tatou to stardom (but after the _da Vinci Code_ she decided to stay in france), and defined a style. But none of the films made in its likeness or style either by him or others every matched the charm of _Amelie_
