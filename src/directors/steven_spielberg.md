Perhaps the most famous Hollywood director ever. And richest? Looking back over this _High concept_ champion and craftsman's list of movies it is really astounding how many hit movies he has churned out.

What is effective Hollywood storytelling? Perhaps it is what made _Duel_ and Spielberg a success story. The relatable hero, the villain without motive, the stripped-bare setting. Then carefully add to it as experience grows. It also helps if the ideas are really good!
