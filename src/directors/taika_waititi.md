New Zeelander stand-up comedian brings his quirky but very on-point humor successfully across over the barrier of script, actors, camera and production. Its refreshing immediacy is often in constructive interference with drama and propelled him from low-budgeted local efforts to big hollywood productions. 

Funny guy. Check out his movies!
