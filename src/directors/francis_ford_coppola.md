Has a beard, made the best movie ever. I mean, if low quality in art is not succeeding in an attempt, and quality is the opposite of that, then not many movies can claim a higher score than _the Godfather_.

Yeah, he made _the Godfather_, there isn't really that much else to say...

Except for a bunch of other movies that are awesome! But here we are with 2 movies per director, so why _Dracula_ and not _Apocalypse Now_? Not that there aren't enough quotable lines in his other movies, but Draculas out-standing camp and oscar-winning cosstume design by Eiko Ishioka and the fact that i saw it as a kid tips it over the edge for me.
