smells like Burton...

Once upon a time, before the 2000, this guy made great movies. Really, its hard to choose! Check out this run of films: _Pee-Wee's Big Adventure_, _Beetlejuice_, _Batman_, _Edward Scissorhands_, _Batman Returns_ (which was almost instead of Scissorhands on this list), _Ed Wood_, _Mars Attacks_ (perhaps an outlier), _Sleepy Hollow_. Then, for some reason, there was a remake of _Planet of the Apes_, which Burton directed. He came back into form with _Big Fish_, But thereafter the formula listed above seemed to have run out of magic.

Be sure to remember, however, that he did **NOT** direct _The Nightmare Before Christmas_, no matter how much his vision that movie was. It's just unfair against Henry Selick.
