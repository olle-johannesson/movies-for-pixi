title: Roman Polanski

Polanski has had an eventful life and career, making a lot of truly awesome movies (and also raping a 13-year-old girl; a point of controversy). His bad movies are still great, his wierd movies have changed what is normal, and his good movies have upped the bar for all other directors in multliple genres.
