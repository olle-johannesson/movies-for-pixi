His IMDB biography is pretty much empty. So is this one. If he reads this page he might ask "You didn't pick _The Truman Show!?_". Well, there are two reasons:

1. Other films are better.
2. Jim Carrey was miscast. He couldn't do the same transition to drama as could Robin Williams; he was still the pet detective. And the ending was a bit... meh.
