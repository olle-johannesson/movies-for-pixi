One of those genre/style directors, had a smash hit with cult classic _Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels_ and then quickly followed up in the same style but with extra budget, extra cast and extra everything. This was also a great success, and brought him fame and fortune enough marry Madonna.

Later efforts plateaued when the style did not translate away from London (and movies he didn't write himself), and he returned to the formula 20 years later with _The Gentlemen_. The question is if the style will develop into a sp√§tstil of action comedy.
