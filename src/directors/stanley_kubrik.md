Why should you watch Kubrik movies? Because they _look. so. fucking. good!_ Also, who doesn't like a slow, oddly disturbing film about some guy who fails at something?

Funnily, when _Eyes wide shut_ came out, everybody were so excited by a movie with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman that was also directed by Stanley Kubrik, that everybody went to see it, regardless how they felt about slow, oddly disturbing movies about men who fail. Then they all complained about how the movie was slow and disturbing and wasn't really about anything except a man who kind of failed at whatever he was trying to do.
