This is one of those directors that all serious film lovers, or posers (is there really a difference?) respect. Just as you go through a phase of mentioning Akira Kurosawa whenever you can, or namedropping Dario Argento and _Suspiria_ (see what I did there?), you go through a John Carpenter phase.

Just as with Kurosawa, though, you're in good company here. Gene Siskel (!) liked almost all of his movies. Yes, its true. And it gives credit to both of them. He almost liked them more than Roger Ebert did. Even _Christine_! Ok so he though _Big Trouble in Little China_ was a bit over the top, but... Yeah.

Also, let's not forget to mention _The Escape From New York_ here. I mean, we're already breaking the 2-movie rule, but I can at mention it here: In it Kurt Russell has another cool character name and look. Don't miss it!
