year: 1987

director: "Rob Reiner"

summary: "Swashbuckling fairy-tale with classic side characters"

comment: "Yes, no, sadly, not 'Stand by Me' or 'This is Spinal Tap'. Reddit is completely in love with this movie, and because you probably spent 1,5 hours scrolling past memes you kind can afford to give it 1,5 hours to watch. Now go post some Spinal Tap memes!"
