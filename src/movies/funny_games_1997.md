title: "Funny Games"

year: 1997

director: "Michael Haneke"

summary: "Two friendly neighbour asks to borrow some eggs..."

comment: "I hate this film. Not because it's bad, it's undeniably great, but it's is painful to watch. There is a lot to be thought about here, as the forth wall. How complicit are you? Why are you watching? And if you don't want to watch, the director made a remake in 2007 in U.S.A."
