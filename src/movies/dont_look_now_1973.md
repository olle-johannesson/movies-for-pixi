title: "Don't Look Now"

year: 1973

director: "Nicolas Roeg"

summary: "A married couple in venice are haunted by visions after the death of their daughter."

comment: "The beauty of venice and the apt metaphore of restoring and old church helps make this a memorable film. Just remember that this is a movie where people see visions; don't get as confused as the characters. And don't let Sutherlands 70s 'stache steal the show."
