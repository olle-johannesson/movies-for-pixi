year: 2004

director: "Mark Waters"

summary: "She grew up in the jungle, but can she survive high school?"

comment: "A cult classic. Probably because it somehow cracked the code of making a high-school comedy that's actually good. This is peak Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams broke out by perfecting her role, and Tina Fey showed her writing skills."
