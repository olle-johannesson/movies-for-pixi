title: "Titanic"

year: 1997

director: "James Cameron"

summary: "A bunch of people go on a cruise. They won't believe what happens next!"

comment: "Yes, The plot is dumb and the characters are flatter than the north atlantic sea on a icy, windless night. Yet Ttitanic is amazingly well made, it won all the oscars, everbody saw it more than once, and it reshaped how movies are made and marketed. Slavoj Žižek made the point that the real catastrophy would have been if everybody had lived and the romance had to crash with reality. That is the role of the ice berg. Compare: Summer with Monika (1953)"
