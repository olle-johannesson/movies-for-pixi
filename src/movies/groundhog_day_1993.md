title: "Groundhog Day"

year: 1993

director: "Harold Ramis"

summary: "A man is trapped in time, reliving the same day over and over again."

comment: "Ultra-classic, loved by audieces and critics alike. This is so well made, and so well acted by Murray, that any effort to even approach this time-travel trope is an instant fail"
