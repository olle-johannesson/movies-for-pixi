title: "Predator"

year: 1987

director: "John McTiernan"

summary: "A group of green beret super macho commando soldiers in the jungle. And one ugly motherfucker..."

comment: "An unlikely cult classic that spawned 1000 sequels, none of them any good (Even the one where Adrien Brody had an action lead(!) ). 80s machismo is at peak box-office yield, but some trend-setting storytelling devices where cleverly used and made this a great watch."
