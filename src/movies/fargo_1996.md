title: "Fargo"

year: 1996

director: "The Coen Brothers"

summary: "A used-car salesman in his midwestern middleclass midlife crisis bites off more than he can chew, and his friendly neighborino detective is right at his heels."

comment: "A comedy with William H. Macy, THAT IS ACTUALLY FUNNY AND GOOD! Incredible, I know, but then it is perhaps the best film of the Coen Brothers. All scenes with Peter Stormare (e.g. when he uses the wood chipper) probably haunts Tarantino every time he picks up a camera."
