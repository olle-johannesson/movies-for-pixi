quotes:
  - "50,000 years ago, there are not even a million people on the planet. Now there's between five and six billion people on the planet, right? Now, if we all have our own individual soul, where do they all come from? Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls? /.../ is that why we're all so specialized?"
  - "Wait! I have to say something stupid."
  - "Maybe we should meet here in five years or something."
