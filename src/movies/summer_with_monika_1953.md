title: "Summer with Monika"

year: 1953

director: "Ingmar Bergman"

summary: "Two teenagers spend a lustfilled vacation on a sailboat. Later on, reality must be faced."

comment: "Not easy to choose only two from Bergman. Adding to the mid-century rumour of the 'swedish sin', I like to think of it as Titanic where the ship doesn't sink."
