title: "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"

year: 2000

director: "Ang Lee"

summary: "A spoiled girl goes on the run, stealing swords, punching people, falling in love, mastering kung fu, cross dressing, not spilling tea! Its China baby! Also, it's Chow Yun-Fat time!"

comment: "This is such a fucking gorgeous movie! Everything it sets out to do it succeedes in, and isn't that a definition of quality in art? Everything you want from this genre you get from this movie (anything else you can find in Rumble in the Bronx). It also revitalised the kung-fu genre in general, and high-budget such especially."
