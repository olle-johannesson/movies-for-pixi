title: "Die Hard"

year: 1988

director: "John McTiernan"

summary: "A regular joe cop battles terrorists in a scyscraper"

comment: "If the Ã¼ber-americana-bald-eagle-screech of 80s action movies don't bother you, this is a goldmine. It was Bruce Willis first action lead, with his great one-liner delivery. It has Alan Rickmans perhaps best villain part, with his fantastic one-liner delivery. Nothing left not to love!"
