title: "Eyes Wide Shut"

year: 1999

director: "Stanley Kubrick"

summary: "The male sexual fantasy fights an uphill battle against its female counterpart, as Tom Cruise goes on an epic journey of failing libido"

comment: "That's right! No Clockwork Orange, No Lolita, 2001 or Dr. Strangelove! This is a movie list with personality, and we're going with Barry Lyndon and Eyes wide shut! I'll review any pull request that tries to change this Kubrik-selection!"
