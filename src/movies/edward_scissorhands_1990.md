title: "Edward Scissorhands"

year: 1990

director: "Tim Burton"

summary: "A freak tries to find a place in a tight-knit community"

comment: "The pastell suburbia with the looming mansion above is almost Wes Anderson-esque. The ugly duckling trope is perhaps a bit overdone by Burton, but this was early, and long before his break with making good movies."
