title: "Am√©lie"

year: 2001

director: "Jean-Pierre Jeunet"

summary: "Shy misfit Amilie plots for a bit of justice in this world, for lovers, haters, and all the small things. But can she help also herself? Of course she can't, SIKE! It wouldn't be a movie if she could!"

comment: "The ultimate pixi-girl movie. Super sweet, and established some tropes that was later shamelessly ripped"
