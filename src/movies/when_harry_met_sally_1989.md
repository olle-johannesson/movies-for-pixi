year: 1989

director: "Rob Reiner"

summary: "A story about two friends, and if men and women can be friends"

comment: "Late 80s feel-good romance a lot of people (including me) have a soft spot for. Billy Crystal is believable in this movie, and you can name something other than Star Wars that Carrie Fisher was in."
