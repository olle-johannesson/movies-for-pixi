            Sometimes the right movie doesn't win. Even on this website life isn't completely fair. It is fairer than in real life, however, and some movies definitely should have faired better than they did there.

            This website doesn't list actors (yet), nor does it writers or cinematographers (again, yet), though they are at least as important as the director. 
            How would Ingmar Bergmans movies be without Sven Nykvist? What would any movie be like <i>sans</i> writer or actors?
            Well, until there's more meta-data on this website, the movie names will have to do. They are the things you'll watch anyway.
