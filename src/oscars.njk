        Welcome to the first oscars of movies Pixi should watch!

            Sometimes the right movie doesn't win. Even on this website life isn't completely fair. It is fairer than in real life, however, and some movies definitely should have faired better than they did. It is time to rectify that.

            So this website doesn't list actors (yet), not does it writers or cinematographers (also, yet), though often they are at least as important as the director (if not more). 
            How much of Bergmans movies would be left without Sven Nykvist? What would be left of any movie without its writer (or actors)?
            Well, before I've added more meta-data to this website, the movie names will have to do. They are the things you'll watch anyway.
