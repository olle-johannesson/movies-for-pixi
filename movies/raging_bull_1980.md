title: "Raging Bull"

year: 1980

director: "Martin Scorsese"

summary: "A rise-and-fall story about a boxer. It's good."

comment: "Don't see any other boxing movies (even if you want to hear Dolph Lundgren say 'I must break you'). There are no other movies about boxing or any other 'the rise and fall of' movies. Not even the Godfather is a 'the rise and fall of'-movie next to this. Someone talks about* Boogie Nights *? That's right, punch 'em in the face!"
