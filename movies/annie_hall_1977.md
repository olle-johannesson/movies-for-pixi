title: "Annie Hall"

year: 1977

director: "Woody Allen"

summary: "Woody Allen cements his on-screen persona when reflecting about life and his ex."

comment: "This is the kind of film comedian Allen IS known for churning out, but it pretty rarely churns out this good. I could have listed any other of his many (many) really (really) good movies here, but it's a bit like tarantino and Pulp Fiction."
