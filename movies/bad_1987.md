year: 1987

director: "Martin Scorsese"

summary: "Michael Jackson dances in a subway station to illustrate how bad he is. His posse and many zippers asserts that he is just bad as he sang he was."

comment: "We're skipping* Taxi Driver *here. Because WAAAT Scorsese did the music video to Bad!? Yes he did indeed, and after that revelation you know what you have to take a second look at."
