title: "Ghost in the Shell"

year: 1995

director: "Mamoru Oshii"

summary: "A bunch of cyborgs shoot guns and philosophise about life and existance."

comment: "This is the difintive action-meets-philosophy effort. The dialogue can be a bit fast, but it's super cool and very impressive. There was an american live-action remake made. Avoid that one."

quotes:
  - "If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. What's true for the group is also true for the individual. It's simple: Overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death."
  - "Your standard-issue Big Gun."
