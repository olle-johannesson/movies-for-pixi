title: "The Fearless Vampire Killers"

year: 1967

director: "Roman Polanski"

summary: "They want to save her, but the castle is vampires!"

comment: "*What!? No* Chinatown*? No* The Pianist*? Vampire killers is like maybe his least recommended film. But it has that totally sexy scene with Sharon Tate in a towel, and after this film Polanski marries her, and then she got murdered by the manson family, and it is eerie seeing her look into his eyes with that in mind. Beat that, Repulsion lovers! This movie list RULES*"
