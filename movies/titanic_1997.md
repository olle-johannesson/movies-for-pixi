title: "Titanic"

year: 1997

director: "James Cameron"

summary: "A bunch of people go on a cruise. They won't believe what happens next!"

comment: "*Not* Aliens*? Not* The Terminator*? Waaaat? Yeah, you probably know that everyone must see those awesome films anyway. But Titanic is both awesome and crap. The plot is dumber than my commit messages. The characters are flatter than the north atlantic sea on a icy, windless night. Yet this movie won all the oscars, everbody saw it more than once, and it reshaped how movies are made and marketed."
