You gotta have an opinion on Tarantino. It doesn't really matter what it is, just make sure to have one. Also, it should have an ironic relationship to old movies, because that what this is pretty much all about. Somewhere on a scale between Hegels dialectic and *Ninja vs Zombie* you will find Tarantino. And your opinion of him slightly to the Hegel side on the same scale.
