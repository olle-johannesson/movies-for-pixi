Quirky Wes grew to be the darling of Hollywood and critics alike when he and college roomate Owen Wilson (and brothers) made _Bottle Rocket_ to great success. He went on to further success and stylistic refinement (as well as growing A-list weight of cast) in following features _The Royal Tennenbaums_ and _Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou_. This peaked with the below films, having assembled fantastic budgets, all-star cast ensembles and a loyal following among fans. Later films have started to crumble under their own weight, though.
