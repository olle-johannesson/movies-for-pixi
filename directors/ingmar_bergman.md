Super-famous art-house master Bergman ruled over his sets as an artist. The films aren't perhaps as easy to digest as any marvel blockbuster, but make no mistake, this is as influential as Chaplin or Welles ever was.

Now, this is a long career of uncompromising filmmaking we're looking at. No film historian could easily pick just two (_The Seventh Seal_ and _Persona_ would probably be chosen over _Sommaren med Monika_ though), and if you are interested in the art form of film, make the effort to see more of this guy.
