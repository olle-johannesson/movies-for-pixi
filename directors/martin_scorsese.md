The guy who doesn't know how to say no to certain actors, god bless him.

If you want a well-made movie that discusses identity but is also extremely violent and is probably on someones must-see-list, this is your first stop.

I have a pet theory that in the future, historians will liken Scorseses role in filmmaking from the 70s onwards to that of Franz Liszt in the music of the 1800s. A virtuosic talent who carried and promoted a whole generation of collegues.
