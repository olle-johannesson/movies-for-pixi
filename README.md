# Movies for Pixi

Pixi, this is a list of movies I like, semi-complete with the quotes from them I usually force into conversations. Please see these films so you know what I mean when I say things like "Game over man, game over!"

Now, I have limited myself to 2 movies per director so it doesn't get too boring to make this list. Please see more movies from each listed director. But start with the ones I've listed, because thats why I listed them.

## Ridley Scott

A british director of commercials started making amazing movies that turned out to be extremely marketable. Then he started making super commercial movies.

### Alien (1979)

An interstellar delivery crew inspects a distress call from an abandoned planet, but they are too late. Because the title card of the movie took too long.

*The best movie ever. A true work of art.*

### Blade Runner (1982)

Oh no, artificially made human slaves have made it back into society! Only Harrison Ford is grumpy enough to deal with this bunch of 4-year-olds!

*Film noir melancholy in a goth-futuristic fever dream slathered in 80s synth-wave. Add a sprinkle of set-decor-extravaganza, and you've got the stuff that dreams like* The Matrix *and* Ghost in the Shell *were made of.* 


## James Cameron

A truck driver who turned out to be the ultimate action/effects-movie master. 

### Terminator 2 (1991)

A robot with a styrian accent travels back in time to prevent the attempted murder of whom he attempted to murder in the past so he can be prevented from attempting to murder him in a past future.

*The heaviest and coolest action movie ever. After you've seen it, reflect on the menagerie of vehicle-action scenes, and how you didn't notice it was a recurring theme. Now THAT's suspension of disbelief!*

> Of course, I'm a terminator!

> (After shooting someone) He'll live.

> John Connor: "You get it?" The Terminator: "No."


### Titanic (1997)

A bunch of people go on a cruise. They won't believe what happens next!

*Not* Aliens*? Not* The Terminator*? Waaaat? Yeah, you probably know that everyone must see those films anyway. But Titanic is special. It is both awesome and crap. The filming is incredible. The dialog is terrible. The effects are amazing. The plot is dumber than my commit messages. The storytelling power is turned up to 11. The characters are flatter than the north atlantic sea on a icy, windless night. This movie reshaped how movies are made and marketed, and has the distinct feel that its thinner-than-paint plot was mysteriously plastered onto another, darker script that wasn't allowed to be made.*

> Teach me to ride like a man.

but still...

### Aliens 

Sure, go back to the aliens. Why not?

*Also the best movie ever. A true work of art.*

> Game over man, game over!

### The Terminator (1984)

The same plot as in the second movie, minus the kid, but with feeling.

*It shows how a truck-driver-gone-film-director made it even with such a strange plot. It is perhaps the ultimate horror film on the theme of unstoppable fate*

> Wash day tomorrow? Nothing clean, right?

> What's for dinner? Plastique.



## The Coen Brothers

### The Big Lebowski (1998)

The audience runs a gauntlet of SoCal stereotypes where new shit constantly comes to light.

*Too many great quotes in this movie to be counted.*

> Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, uhm, your opinion, man.


### No Country for Old Men (2007)

A guy finds a briefcase full of money in the desert, is hunted by a hitman, Tommy Lee Jones doesn't understand.

*This movie is famous for A) a bad haircut B) No soundtrack C) it's really good!

> I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He'd have to say, "O.K., I'll be part of this world."

### Fargo (1996)

A used-car salesman in his midwestern middleclass midlife crisis bites off more than he can chew, and his friendly neighborino detective is right at his heels.

*A comedy with William H. Macy, THAT IS ACTUALLY FUNNY AND GOOD! Incredible, I know, but then it is perhaps the best film of the Coen Brothers. All scenes with Peter Stormare (e.g. when he uses the wood chipper) probably haunts Tarantino every time he picks up a camera.*

> You betcha!



## Al Pacino

Ok not a director, but whatevvs

### Scent of a woman (1992)

Experience tests a young mans idealism when he is taught about principals from someone who lost his.

*Al pacinos only good non-mob-related movie. Pretty cheesy by modern standards, but still with the patos for lines that only the 80s and 90s scripts could muster.*

> Outta order. Who the hell you think you're talkin' to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see. And I have seen boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off. But there isn't nothin' like the sight of an amputated spirit (I quote this more often than i should. Who cares if anyone gets the reference, it's awesome to say!)





### The Godfather (1972)

When the son of a mob boss is forced to get involved in the family business he learns that history, identity and loyalty never comes for free.

*Also the best movie ever. A true work of art.*

> I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

> Look how they massacred my boy!


## Martin Scorsese

The guy who doesn't know how to say no to certain actors, god bless him.

### Raging Bull (1980)

A story about a boxer. It's good.

*Don't see any other boxing movies (even if you want to hear Dolph Lundgren say "I must break you"). There are no other movies about boxing or any other "the rise and fall of" movies. Not even the Godfather is a "the rise and fall of"-movie next to this. Someone talks about* Boogie Nights *? That's right, punch 'em in the face!*


### Michael Jackson: Bad (1987)

Michael Jackson dances in a subway station to illustrate how bad he is. His posse and many zippers asserts that he is just bad as he sang he was.

*We're skipping* Taxi Driver *here. Because WAAAT Scorsese did the music video to Bad!? Yes he did indeed, and after that revelation you know what you have to take a second look at.*


## Quentin Tarantino

You gotta have an opinion on Tarantino. It doesn't really matter what it is, just make sure to have one. Also, it should have an ironic relationship to old movies, because that what this is pretty much all about. Somewhere on a scale between Hegels dialectic and *Ninja vs Zombie* you will find Tarantino. And your opinion of him slightly to the Hegel side on the same scale.

### Pulp Fiction (1994)

Hard-boiled soundbites are served up by a star chef cinematographer as a sequence of tough guys are sequentially suprised.

*Whenever someone makes a tarantino-list, this–unlike any other of his films–has to be on it*





### True Romance (1993)

Gary Oldman plays a wannabe black pimp, Dennis Hopper plays Christian Slaters dad, Val Kilmer plays Elvis, and Brad Pitt plays someone who is poor and unhealthy in this type-casting bonanza!

*If you want to be cool like me, you mention this when asked about your favourite tarantino movie. Fuck them reservoir dogs-lovers! Now, yes, there is a enourmous rift between the first and second part of this movie, and yes, perhaps they should have been different movies. When you sit there at the end and think "was that exposition really necessary to end up with this?" then yes is was and aren't you glad you watched it? Yes you are! Yes True Romance!*





## Roberto Benigni

Hey, watch a Roberto Benigni film, its going to be better that 99% of whatever else is on TV anyway.

### Life is beautiful (1997)

*Fuck you if you can watch this without crying*



## Stanley Kubrick

Why should you watch Kubrik movies? Because they look. so. fucking. good! Also, who doesn't like a slow, oddly disturbing film about some guy who fails at something?

### Barry Lyndon (1975)

A 18th century man is the pawn of circumstance until he attempts to seize his fate. And fails, because this is a Kubrik film.

*Just look at it! Jesus Christ it looks good! The Composition is so perfected, it is almost hard not to sometimes pause this already super slow movie.*



### Eyes wide shut (1999)

The male sexual fantasy fights an uphill battle against its female counterpart, as Tom Cruise goes on an epic journey of failing libido 

*Another Kubrick movie that looks spectacular and is about a man that fails. See this movie if you want to talk about movies with people who dont like a movie you have seen but they are wrong.*

*That's right! No Clockwork Orange, No Lolita, 2001 or Dr. Strangelove! This is a movie list with personality, and we're going with Barry Lyndon and Eyes wide shut! I'll review any pull request that tries to change this Kubrik-selection!*





## Roman Polanski

Polanski has had an eventful life and career, making a lot of truly awesome movies (and also raping a 13-year-old girl; a point of controversy). His bad movies are still great, his wierd movies have changed what is normal, and his good movies have upped the bar for all other directors in multliple genres.

### Rosemary's baby (1968)

A womans pregnancy is spoiled because of her annoying neighbours

*Polanski tells us that actors will do pretty much anything for a role. This is the favourite movie of the only film critic whose podcast I subscribe to. And that's gotta be worth something.*



### The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967)

They want to save her, but the castle is vampires!

*What!? No* Chinatown*? No* The Pianist*? Vampire killers is like maybe his least recommended film. But it has that totally sexy scene with Sharon Tate in a towel, and after this film Polanski marries her, and then she got murdered by the manson family, and it is eerie seeing her look into his eyes with that in mind. Beat that, Repulsion lovers! This movie list RULES*



## Woody Allen

This guy made a new hollywood movie every year for almost 1000 years. He also solidified his position in the wierdo-movie-director camp by marrying his adopted kid. Some of the films are crap, some are completely brilliant.

### Match Point (2005)

For this tennis coach, it's game, set and smash with Scarlett Johansson. But will love interfere with his creepy plans of social mobility?

*This is not the kind of film comedian Allen is known for churning out, but it is one of the gems in his collection.*

### Annie Hall (1977)

Woody Allen cements his on-screen persona when reflecting about life and his ex.

*This is the kind of film comedian Allen is known for churning out, but it pretty rarely turns out this good. I could have listed any other of his many (many) really (really) good movies here, but it's a bit like tarantino and* Pulp Fiction. 




## Misc.


### The Apartment (1960)

A man has a too good apartment. It turns into a problem.

*Machine-gun-speed dialog are not just for film noire, but there's enough darkness under the hood of this comedy to be caustic.*


*TODO: Insert* Some like it hot *here*




### Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain (2001)

Shy misfit Amilie plots for a bit of justice in this world, for lovers, haters, and all the small things. But can she help also herself? Of course she can't, SIKE! It wouldn't be a movie if she could!

*The director followed Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher directing in the* Alien *series. You know the "keeell meee" scene in* Alien: Resurrection*?. Yeah, he did that. Then he did this. Like, it was his next film!*





### Casablanca (1942)

When nazis and his ex-girlfriend suddendly walk in the door, a bar owner is forced to make a descision.

*The origin of 50% of all movie cliches and tropes. If you havn't seen this, you havn't seen anything. Or Paris*


### A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)

A girl walks home alone at night.

*This is an Iranian art-house spaghetti-western vampire movie in black-and-white. Yes, you read that right.*



### Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)

A spoiled girl goes on the run, stealing swords, punching people, falling in love, mastering kung fu, cross dressing, not spilling tea! Its China baby! Also, it's Chow Yun-Fat time!

*This is such a fucking gorgeous movie! Everything it sets out to do it succeedes in, and isn't that a definition of quality in art? Everything you want from this genre you get from this movie (anything else you can find in* Rumble in the Bronx*).*

*Also, let's not forget Michelle Yeoh, and Chow Yun-Fat. If there is one actor you didn't think you'd want to watch a lot of movies by, it is him. They are great. He is great. This movie is great!*



### Du Levande (2007)

A rhapsodic exposé of life and an esthetic that could be the love child of Edward Hopper and Gary Larson.

*Would you like to turn on a movie and see something you didn't expect but it's awesome. Try this.*

### Le Havre (2011)

In a dead-pan universe, a shoe shiner is the hero we need, not the one we deserve.

*The same year as Midnight in Paris and Melancholia. It was a good year for cinema. Consider* The Man Without a Past *from the same director. Yes, he is finnish, if you couldn't tell.*
